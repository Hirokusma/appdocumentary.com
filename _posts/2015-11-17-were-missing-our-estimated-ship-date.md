Last summer, we set out to make something incredible for a community we care a lot about. It's been an amazing journey. Thanks to the support of over 2,000 backers and those of you who have made pre-orders, we have been able to work on the film full time since we funded, with only 5%-10% of our production time this last year going towards side projects to keep gas in the tank. We've discovered that learning in public and making a great feature-length documentary film are more difficult than we anticipated. We're getting there, though, and we are going to deliver something beyond what even we set out to make. It’s just taking a little more time than we thought. Go figure. We shared the news with our backers yesterday and the response has been so encouraging.

Moving forward, it looks like we're going to have 90 minutes cut by the end of the year, but it's going to be far from something we would want to show publicly.  The feedback that we've heard from you regarding the level of thought and production we've been putting into the project has been incredibly energizing, as we see you're catching the vision for the quality of film we're going for. 

So in order to do right by our backers, and the film and those in it, we are concentrating on making it the best it can be. Thank you for your patience and support.

Best,<br>
