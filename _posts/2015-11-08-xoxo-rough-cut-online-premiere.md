Wow. It's time! It feels like a lifetime ago that we premiered the cut you're about to watch at XOXO Fest. What you're going to see is a rough cut of the first 12 or so minutes of the film + a short teaser at the end.

We're so grateful to those of you who have supported the film&mdash;especially over the last few months with your encouraging words and re-tweets of shorts. Last, but far from least, we'd like to thank super backer Gabriel Cubbage from [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/) for jumping on as our Premiere Sponsor for the online release of this cut. Through these combined efforts, we have been able to keep our heads down, pushing the film forward. 

We hope you enjoy this, and we hope you take time to tell us how it could be better and that you'll be a part of shaping a film that really represents this community well. 

Enjoy!

Much love,<br>
Jake & Jed<br>

p.s. We fully acknowledge that this edit skews male. Please know that giving a voice to women in tech and inspiring the next generation of young women to get into this field is something we care deeply about. As the film progresses, we're excited to introduce you to some other great characters we have been following.
