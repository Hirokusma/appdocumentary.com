Hello and welcome to our new blog! We’re excited to have a permanent home for our writing and to share our process more in-depth&mdash;docs we’re watching and analyzing, news we’re reading, people we're talking to, potential plot-lines and angles we're discussing, etcetera. We’re also looking forward to writing about some of the technical challenges we’re facing and the solutions we have devised.

For those of you following our updates on Kickstarter, you may of course continue to do so. We will continue posting notable milestones there. However, if you'd like more frequent and in-depth posts, you'll find them here.

Subscribe to our [RSS feed](/feed.xml) to stay up to date. Also, we'll [tweet](http://twitter.com/appdocu) any time we post, if that's more your flavor.
