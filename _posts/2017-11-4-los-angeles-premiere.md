The Los Angles Premiere of App: The Human Story comes to the beautiful Art Theatre in Long Beach's historic Retro Row, Thursday, Nov 16th, at 7:30 pm.

This feature length documentary gives a voice to the passionate community of indie app developers. App: The Human Story is a look at the coming of age of an all new art form.

With the launch of the iPhone and subsequent devices, developers found themselves with a worldwide market hungry for their innovations: apps.

Yet, a renaissance needs cultivation, not exploitation. Ten years in, is the opportunity gone? Will artists find a way to create tools that elevate the human experience, or will the market be valued even above the impact to the future of the industry?

Tickets are $10 and available at the door and online soon. Backers who purchased premiere tickets during the film's Kickstarter campaign are encouraged to RSVP via email to <a href="mailto:co@storyandpixel.com">co@storyandpixel.com</a>. They will enjoy VIP seating and are invited to a pre-screening mixer with complimentary drinks at 7 pm to meet the attending cast and crew. 

Many cast and crew of the film will be in attendance and there will be a Q&A panel after the film.

For parents considering bringing their children, please be aware there is some infrequent swearing in the film.
