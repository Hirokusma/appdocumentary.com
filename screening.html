        <h1>WWDC Screening</h1>
        <p>
          We are holding and early screening of App at WWDC and we want you to be able to see it&mdash;even if you can't be in San Jose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is to set a threshold and, if there is enough interest, hire some pros to produce a live online stream of the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested, you can pre-order your streaming ticket for $15. For your support, we will include a copy of the finished film when it comes out. If we can hit 600 pre-orders, we will then (and only then) bill everyone and move forward with the live stream.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that sounds like something you're interested in, add your email address and we will notify you in a week or so when we have the pre-order system built.
        </p>
